        <p class="text"><span style="font-weight:bold">The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test</span> is a multistage aerobic capacity test that 
            progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will 
            begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but 
            gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. 
            [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. 
            [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. 
            The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. 
            The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.</p>
