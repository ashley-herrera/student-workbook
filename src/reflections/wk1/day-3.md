What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
>Design displays how much work and effort has been put into your site. People are attracted to a clean layout and easy to use navigation system. If it's clunky and falling appart people will think you only care about the money going into the site and not the customer service.
