# Friday
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.
>I definitely struggled with understanding some of the topics. I was worried that I would fall behind and the class would go by to fast for me. I was so nervous, but I soon discovered that I could get lots of help just by asking questions. I learned so much more from talking to other people and collaborating with others. It truly is a blessing to be working with such a wonderful group of people in person.
