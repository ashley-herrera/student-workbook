>It's hiding exposed code. If someone had access to your code they could steal information.

>Model View Console

Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
>The service is where the functions are created and the brains of the code are at work. The controller then takes those function and turns them into readable information. Once it does that it is passed on to the View where the user interacts with the website.
