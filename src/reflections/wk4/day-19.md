What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
>It stands for Representational State Transfer. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol.

What does Stateless mean?
>It calculates its internal state but it never directly mutates it. It can't edit any information either.


What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
>URLs should include nouns, not verbs. Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
