# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Synchronus code runs from top to bottom in order of code. Asynchronus allows blocks of code to run at different times so the whole page can load before having to execute anything.
```
**2.** What is an event listener?

```
**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The open-closed principle.
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be “called back” at a later time. A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the callback function gets executed.
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A promise is created from an async method which tells the function that it can run. catch() is used to capture an error from a promise.
```
**6.** Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

```
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Application programming interface. It's a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
```
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The controller is responsible for calling the api.
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Encapsulation hides important information from the viewer.
```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The HTTP response code for a successful request is 2xx.
```
**11.** What is a 500 error?
