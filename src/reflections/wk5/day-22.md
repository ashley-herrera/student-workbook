What are the three types of relationships?
>The three types of relationships are one to one, one to many, and many to many. One to one is a relationship between two entities. One to many is where one side can have more than one relationship while the reverse relationship can only have one. Many to many is a relationship between two entities where they both might have many relationships between each other.

What are the benefits of the traditional linking of relationships instead of Embedding
>Traditional linking allows for easier access to the object. When embedded, the object can get lost and it's difficult to grab it's information.

What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?
>A many to many relationship requires a lot of controllers and services. It's difficult to keep track of the relationships. I will typically start with the first item and map it to its corresponding relationships on paper. After that I move on to the second item and do the same thing.
