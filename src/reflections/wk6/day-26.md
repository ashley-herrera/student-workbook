What is Component based architecture?
>Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. An individual component for example would be like a chat window in Facebook.

What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
>Components each have their own interfaces. Calls to the server are made directly from the client-side, allowing for the DOM to be dynamically updated without the need of a page refresh. This allows one component to reload instead of an entire page.

What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
>Component based architecture works with 3rd party items. If one of those goes down then it can cause the site to break because it's not receiving any information from it.
