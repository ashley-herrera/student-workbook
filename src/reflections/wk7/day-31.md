What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
>Code documentation is basically taking notes within the code itself to help guide you and any others that may look through your code. Some ways to document code are howto guides, a README in the repo or code documentation in the source.

What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
Code documentation makes it easier for other programmers to read how your code works. It's also useful for writing pseudo code which can allow you to plan out your steps.

How important is Code documentation and why?
Code is still machine language and reading it on its own makes it difficult to find the intentions behind the code. They're used as a guide and reminders so you don't loose track of what you were doing.
