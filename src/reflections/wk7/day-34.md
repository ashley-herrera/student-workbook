# Thursday
Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
> I tried to implement code documentation. I wrote notes to myself reminding me what the functions would do. There were also some other notes sprinkled about.

What went well?
>The partner programming went really well. We worked off of each other by explaining certain elements and pointing out any mistakes that were made. Being able to talk out issues with another person really gets you thinking and now you have two minds working on one problem. It allows you to get other perspectives.

What would you do differently?
>I would have worked more on the UX. Our group was so focused on the back end and trying to get the website working we had no time for front end. If we could have had our time managed better, we could have gotten our website to be a lot more appealing.
